# Welcome to the Okta Integration Workshop for Microsoft 365

## Today we are going to learn the following topics:

- How to integrate Okta with Microsoft 365
- How to assign licences and roles based on group membership
- How to secure and limit access to Microsoft 365

## Before we start

Some prerequisites are required for this workshop. Don't stress, your Okta tenant is already prepared and waiting for you. All you need to do is create a Microsoft 365 developer tenant by following the step-by-step guide.
If you have a Microsoft Office 365 tenant that can be used for testing purposes, you can skip the section on creating a developer tenant and start with the tenant preparation.

## Initial sign in to your Okta tenant
